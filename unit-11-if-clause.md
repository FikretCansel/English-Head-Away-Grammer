Got it 👍 I’ll explain **IF CLAUSES completely in English**, clearly and step by step.

# IF CLAUSES (Conditionals)

**If clauses** are used to talk about **conditions and results**.
They mean: **“If something happens, this is the result.”**

There are **4 main types** of conditionals in English.

---

## 1️⃣ Zero Conditional (General truths)

Used for things that are **always true** (facts, rules, scientific truths, habits).

### Structure:

```
If / When + present simple, present simple
```

### Examples:

* **If you heat ice, it melts.**
* **If I drink coffee at night, I can’t sleep.**
* **When it rains, the ground gets wet.**

🔹 *If* and *when* can both be used.
🔹 There is **no future meaning** here — it’s always true.

---

## 2️⃣ First Conditional (Real & possible future)

Used for **real and possible situations in the future**.

### Structure:

```
If + present simple, will + base verb
```

### Examples:

* **If it rains, I will stay at home.**
* **If you study, you will pass the exam.**
* **If I see her, I’ll tell her the truth.**

🔹 The condition is **possible**.
🔹 We use **present simple**, NOT future, after *if*.

❌ *If it will rain…*
✅ *If it rains…*

---

## 3️⃣ Second Conditional (Unreal / imaginary present or future)

Used for **imaginary, unreal, or unlikely situations** in the present or future.

### Structure:

```
If + past simple, would + base verb
```

### Examples:

* **If I had a lot of money, I would travel the world.**
* **If I were you, I would quit that job.**
* **If she lived closer, she would visit us more often.**

🔹 The situation is **not real** or **not likely**.
🔹 **“Were”** is used for all subjects in formal English:

> *If I were you…*

---

## 4️⃣ Third Conditional (Unreal past)

Used to talk about the **past**, especially **regrets** or **imaginary past results**.

### Structure:

```
If + past perfect, would have + past participle
```

### Examples:

* **If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.**
* **If we had left earlier, we wouldn’t have missed the train.**
* **If she had known, she would have helped us.**

🔹 The past **cannot be changed**.
🔹 Often used to express **regret**.

---

## 🔄 Mixed Conditionals (extra but important)

Used when **time in the if-clause and result are different**.

### Example:

* **If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.**
  (past condition → present result)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ *If I will see him, I tell him*
✅ **If I see him, I will tell him**

❌ *If I was you…* (informal OK, but…)
✅ **If I were you…** (correct & formal)

## 🧠 Quick Summary Table

| Type   | Meaning               | Structure                     |

| Second | Unreal present/future | If + past, would              |
| Third  | Unreal past           | If + past perfect, would have |
